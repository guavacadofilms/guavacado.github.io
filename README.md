# guavacado.github.io

Website I built for my freelance videography portfolio using HTML and CSS (made responsive using JS)
Nav bar contains following sections:

Home - front page with simple title and background video
Portfolio - page with embedded YT videos to function as a portfolio
About - simple text
Contact - timeline with steps outlining the creative process of a project

Used fontawesome to add icons for mobile menu and social media icons at bottom of page.
